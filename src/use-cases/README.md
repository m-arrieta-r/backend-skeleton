## Use cases (not an architecture layer)

Some people called it vertical slicing. I like the term use case driven development. Every application I have worked could easily be shown as use cases diagram.
This folder applies for MVPs where you don't need complex or enterprise projects where you want to add DDD, clean architecture.
