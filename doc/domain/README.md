## Domain (Enterprise business rules)

A prefect place to DDD

**Optional** if you don't have a complex business (domain) rules (invariants) potencially you don't wanna need this layer.
For examples: normally the MVP only need a simple CRUD my recommendation is if you are just testing an idea.

So, when to use DDD?
